### Plans for modules ###
#########################

Planning on having a set of different prefixes which have different commands.
For example, there would be a set of commands with the prefix 'dice.<command>', as well as 'cal.<command>' ('cal' as in 'calendar'), 'col.<command> ('col' as in color)
This would allow for reusing of commands but under a certain group of commands, like an object when coding.
